    <H1>Daniel Hahn's Resume</H1>
        <h2><strong>Web Developer:</strong></h2>
             <p><strong>10+ years success in Web Develpment and CRM for high-growth organisations.</strong></p>
             <p>After spending over ten years immersed in the fields of account and project management, I made a deliberate choice to redirect my professional trajectory towards web development, which has always been my enduring passion. My initial experience in this domain took place at Wex Photo Video, where I diligently honed my skills in web development.
            <br />
            Following that, as a Client Pre-Sales & Delivery Manager at Sekura Mobile Intelligence, I played a crucial role in facilitating the seamless onboarding process for new clients and partners onto their cutting-edge API platform.
            <br />
            During my time as the Lead Knowledge Engineer at Rainbird Technologies Ltd., not only did I spearhead complex projects for prestigious clients like NHS and EY but also undertook the monumental task of writing and contructing their comprehensive knowledge base on how to use their specialized programming language RBlang.
            <br />
            Now ready to embark on an exclusive path as a Web Developer, I bring with me a proactive and strategic mindset that combines extensive project management expertise with profound knowledge of web development technologies. With unwavering dedication to delivering dynamic yet innovative web solutions, I am excited about utilizing my diverse skill set to create engaging and impactful digital experiences.</p>
